My name is Caitlin Meyer and I am a Research & Education Librarian at Yale. I teach in the curriculum in the Yale School of Medicine, coordinate the library workshop program, and am currently exploring the expansion of our online education offerings.  Prior to Yale, I was a member of the <a href="https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/"WI+RE Team at UCLA Library</a>.<BR>
